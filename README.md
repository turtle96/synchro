# Synchro (Android)
Made for Orbital 2016. Supports Android 4.0.3 (SDK 15) and up.

Only available for NUS students with valid NUSNET accounts so far, login is via IVLE authentication

## Purpose
Aims to provide a platform for NUS students to be able to easily group up with other students, whether for school projects, studying, or playing games. We identified a need for a more effective and flexible method of grouping up with people given that the user does not know many people in the university. This app can hopefully help more introverted people to find people with common interests and expand their networks. Also, the app would be a convenient way for people with many group projects to keep track of their progresses.

## Implemented Features
### Create Group (CRUD)
Group page will be available for all other users to view after creation.
Groups can be tagged with multiple tags to increase visibility when other users are searching.
### Search Other Groups
All groups are publicly listed. Groups can also be searched by tags.
### Profiles
Able to view other users' profiles, other users will be able to view your profile as well.
Personal self-intro can be edited.
Note: Profile will collect the following from IVLE: name, faculty, major, and modules
### Group Forum/Chat
Able to post messages in the group for other members to view.
Note: Does not support live updates, need to manually refresh the page for updates
